# PERSONAL MACHINE LEARNING PLAYGROUND

Welcome to my personal Machine Learning Playground! This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that I've developed while learning various aspects of machine learning and data science.

## Overview

This folder houses a diverse range of machine learning projects, each focusing on different algorithms, techniques, and datasets. These projects serve as a practical application of theoretical concepts and a testament to my growing skills in the field of machine learning.

## Project Structure

Each subfolder represents a unique mini-project, typically including:

- A main Python script or Jupyter notebook
- Dataset(s) used (or not ;) )
- README with project-specific details

## Key Learning Areas

Through these projects, I've explored:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Various ML algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, clustering)
- Model evaluation and validation techniques
- Data visualization
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
